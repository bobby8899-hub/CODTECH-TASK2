# <ins>Project Name</ins> :- Interactive Quiz Application

This code is for a simple interactive quiz application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here’s an overview of its structure and functionality:

1. **<ins>HTML Structure</ins>**:-
   - The main container includes:
     - A **title** ("Quiz App") displayed at the top.
     - A **quiz area** (`div` with `id="quiz"`) where questions and options are dynamically populated by JavaScript.
     - A **result area** (`div` with `id="result"`) where the user’s score is shown after submitting answers.
   - **Buttons**: 
     - **Submit** button to submit answers and calculate the score.
     - **Retry** button (initially hidden) to reset the quiz for another attempt.
     - **Show Answer** button (initially hidden) to display correct answers after submission.

2. **<ins>CSS and JavaScript Integration<ins>**:-
   - External **CSS file** (`styles.css`) is linked in the `<head>` for styling.
   - The JavaScript file (`script.js`) is linked at the end of the body, responsible for generating questions, handling user interactions, calculating scores, and controlling the visibility of buttons.

3. **<ins>Functionality</ins>**:
   - JavaScript controls the quiz flow:
     - **Generating Questions**: Displays questions and options within the `quiz` div.
     - **Score Calculation**: On clicking **Submit**, JavaScript evaluates the selected answers and displays the score in the `result` div.
     - **Retry and Show Answer** buttons**: After submitting, these buttons allow users to either retry the quiz or view the correct answers.

This setup provides a basic, user-friendly quiz interface that allows users to answer questions, see their score, and retry or review correct answers.
